# SynthBloks Proof Of Concept modules
SynthBloks are modular synthesizer modules in a fun form factor.

This repository contains SynthBlocks PoC modules based on pre-existing, open source designs. These are used to validate the design of the form factor itself, and are not meant to represent a final product. They are only meant as a reference for developing future SynthBlocks modules. This seperates development of modules from the development of the standard to which they conform.

oldBloks contains designs for first-party modules, which have been temporarily abandoned in favor of developing the standard using PoC modules. PoC modules are given their own folders, named according to function and source.

### Development
You can follow the development of this project, among many others, on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wubb_gmbaa).

### Legal Stuff
